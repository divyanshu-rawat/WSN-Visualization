TEEN: A Routing Protocol for Enhanced Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks.

Wireless sensor networks are expected to find wide applicability and increasing deployment in the near future. In this paper, we propose a formal classification of sensor networks, based on their mode of functioning, as proactive and reactive networks. Reactive networks, as opposed to passive data collecting proactive networks, respond immediately to changes in the relevant parameters of interest. We also introduce a new energy efficient protocol, TEEN (Threshold sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network protocol) for reactive networks. We evaluate the performance of our protocol for a simple temperature sensing application. In terms of energy efficiency, our protocol has been observed to outperform existing conventional sensor network protocols.
